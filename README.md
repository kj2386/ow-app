## Description

Basic Overwatch player search that displays Quickplay and Competitive data. Currently other player's profiles could only be viewed in game while your own profile can be viewed in game and on playOverwatch's site. Blizzard does not have an API for Overwatch yet so I used a third party API. https://ow-api.com/

Profiles must be set to public.

### Tech Used:

JS, REACT, Bulma CSS framework, and deployed on Heroku
